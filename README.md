TCR motifs associated with infectious conditions

Personal contribution to the project "Algorithms for the biomarkers search in the repertoires of T-cell receptors, 
applicable to the analysis of immunological memory for various pathogens".

Aims:

1. Analyze the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cells in healthy, ill and recovered patients
2. Compare the magnitude of immune response in individuals, sampled during COVID-19 pandemic, and individuals, sampled before 2020
3. Create a classifier in order to distinguish between healthy and ill patients, based on T-cell repertoire
