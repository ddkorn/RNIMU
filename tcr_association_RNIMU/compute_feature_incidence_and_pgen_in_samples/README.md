Computing of feature incidence and probability of CDR3 generation (pgen) in samples.
P0 - number of target clonotypes in the sample divided by total number of clonotypes in the sample.
P0VJ - number of target clonotypes with the same V and J segments and no more than one substitution in cdr3aa in the sample divided by total number of clonotypes in the sample.
P1VJ - number of target clonotypes with the same V and J segments and no more than one substitution in cdr3aa in the sample divided by total number of clonotypes with the same V and J segments in the sample.
